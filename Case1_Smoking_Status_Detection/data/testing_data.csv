January 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy . The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection . The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 . In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative . She received postoperative chemotherapy . In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan . The exploratory laparotomy was negative . She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up . In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan . In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window . She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis . She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass . The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer . The past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .

On physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice . The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular . Chest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base . She has a previous right mastectomy . regular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop . obese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds . The rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses . no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . The neurological examination is nonfocal . The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital . The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass . This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology . The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely . She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion . This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation . This additional chest tube was removed the following day . Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 . Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable . Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three . The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six . Percocet for pain . Follow up with Dr. Fede Duhenile .

She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing . She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 . In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded . In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation . She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 . In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block . She had exertional angina at that time . In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft . She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis . Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin . She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here . In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic . She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect . She has had no syncope . Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol . She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction . She is a remote cigarette smoker . She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages . She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy . She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci She lives alone . Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville . They live in Ohio . She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds . Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular . Neck veins are not distended . Respiratory rate 12 . no bruits . Lungs were clear . 1/6 systolic ejection murmur . Abdomen was benign . Peripheral pulses intact . Neurological examination non-focal . On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing . Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal . Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 . The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory . There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 . Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex . She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction . Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch . The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded . The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded . The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery . This was considered her culprit lesion . This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft . In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs . Her left internal mammary artery was also unused . It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead . She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing . This was intermittent . The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed . The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker . It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure . Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately . She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time . When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina . Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable . The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft . He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction . For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates . The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service . On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing . There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads . It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode . She tolerated this well . Her medications were resumed . She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography . Biopsy of this specific area was negative . Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change . However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time . Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy . An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm . The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma . She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) . The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin . The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion . ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase . DNA content was deployed . On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma . Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery . She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well . Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization . Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .

No other areas of hemorrhage identified . the area of hemorrhage the same , slightly more edema and mass effect . no evidence of pulmonary emboli . Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua 's cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension . A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage . At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery . She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem . The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .

It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide . The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient 's young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient . So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet . hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. po q.day , Captopril 75 mg. po three times a day , Nifedipine 40 mg. po three times a day .
